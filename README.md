# Design-Presentation
Team Z (Design Presentation)
Our project aims to develop a web site for those who are interested in Chinese food to share their feelings of those food.  To make our project more interactive and typical, we design our logo as a red dragon which represents luck and beautiful wishes in China. Specially, we provides many search functions for searching food: either style or category or both of them. Besides, we have a ranking list in the sequence of “likes” decreasing. These functions list above can both for those registered visitor or non-registered visitor. However, we only provide vote functions for registered user. When user log in their account, they can vote for the food they like. If they logged out, the vote button will disappear. 

For further development:  
1.	We will provide a link on food page: link to a video showing how to make it. 
2.	Let user to add comment
3.	See their comment history
4.	Make the vote function work correctly
